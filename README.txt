Simple rock, paper, scissors game through the console.

v1: 1/17/18
 Created a random number generator and 
 Contained alot of functions that performed multiple expressions and ended up creating a loop.
v2: 1/18/18
 More streamlined than the first one and actually works. Done this by associating the integer values from the generator to string values. Then by comparing the two string, the player wins, loses or ties.
v3: 
 will add a prompt to enter the play thru the browser and a scoreboard.
